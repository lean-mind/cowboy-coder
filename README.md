This project implements a plugin that writes the information contained in a buffer
at every keystroke.

That buffer information can be changed in the file TrainingCoursesHandler or CowboyCoderHandler depending on the branch you are at.

Once all changes have been applied, you can build the project with gradle and a .jar file with the name `cowboy-coder-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` will be created in the folder 
`build/libs`.
After generating it, you can import it into the plugin menu of your IDE and use it.

You can see how the plugin works when it is enabled in the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V-mFI4OCE4).
